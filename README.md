## API Documentation

For detailed API documentation, visit: https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/23808049/2sA2xb5F75

## Rate Limits

HeyReach API allows a maximum of 300 requests per minute. The node includes automatic rate limit handling.

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Campaign Pause/Resume Errors
**Issue**: Getting "You cannot pause an inactive campaign" error
**Solution**: This node includes smart error handling that automatically verifies if the campaign was actually paused despite the API error. The operation will succeed if the campaign status changes correctly.

#### API Rate Limits
**Issue**: Receiving rate limit errors
**Solution**: The node includes automatic rate limiting (300 requests/minute). If you hit limits, the node will automatically retry with exponential backoff.

#### Authentication Errors
**Issue**: "Invalid API key" or authentication failures
**Solution**:
1. Verify your API key in HeyReach Settings > API Keys
2. Ensure the credential is properly saved in n8n
3. Test the connection using the "Test" button in credentials

#### Node Not Appearing
**Issue**: HeyReach node doesn't appear in n8n node palette
**Solution**:
1. Restart your n8n instance after installation
2. Clear browser cache (Cmd+Shift+R)
3. Check n8n logs for installation errors

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging by setting the environment variable:
```bash
export N8N_LOG_LEVEL=debug
```
